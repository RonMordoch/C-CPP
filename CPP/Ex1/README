== EXERCISE DESCRIPTION ==
In this exercise we implemented a program to find the prime factors of 2 numbers from a finite
galois field.
I implemented the GField class with fields of char and degree and the GFNumber class
with fields of number value and field.
The algorithms used to find the prime factors are Pollard's Rho algorithm and the Brute Force
algorithm which implement the Trail Division method.
