== EXERCISE DESCRIPTION ==
Receiving input from command line, we validate the input gathered from cli.
After we validate the text file and create a graph from it, we check the 2 nodes received exist
in the graph, and validate the graph is indeed a tree.
Once we validated all of that, we run DFS, implemented by the recursive explore function, and BFS,
implemented using a queue, to get the data we need to print results.

In this exercise I used advanced C techniques:
- Dynamic memory allocation for the structs
- Pointers to pointers, keeping pointer to array of nodes
- Error propagating from different functions
