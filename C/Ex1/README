== EXERCISE DESCRIPTION ==
In this exercises, we used input received from user to perform the mathematical concept of
convolution.
Using the skeleton of the ReadLines program we received, I read all 3 lines of the input, and
after validating every aspect of the lines I performed the following:
1. Centralize the input arrays
2. Normalize the input arrays
3. Perform n-convolutions
4. Calculate max and print the results

In this exercise, I used the basics of C - for/while loops, working with arrays, and using static
arrays.

All the constant values in the program were declared as constants using #define.
